        "A game developed my me and 3 others for a class. The idea is two players much navigate through various puzzles to complete levels.",
        "One person is the \"Audio\" player, as he cannot see objects as you would expect. Walls aren\"t visible to him, making it harder to navigate, but also allowing him to see more of the map.",
        "The other player is \"Visual\", he see\"s objects as expected. Allowing him to better understand the layout of the level."
